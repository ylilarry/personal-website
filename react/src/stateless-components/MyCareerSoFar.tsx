          Always up for trying out and studying new technologies, I have worked
          in different areas of software engineering since 2012, including web
          development, mobile development, database engineering, data science
          and machine learning. I have been employed in technical roles at SAP
          Canada, the University of Waterloo, as well as a start-up company as a
          technical co-founder. I am sure my versatile experience will be a
          great asset to your team.
