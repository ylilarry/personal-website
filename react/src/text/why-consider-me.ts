    text: `If you are looking for a senior fullstack engineer who has a diverse experience in 
    different areas of software design & engineering, as well as a mindset of entrepreneurship,
    then I am a great fit for your team. I work daily with web technologies such as React, GraphQL, AWS, 
    as well as data science technologies such as Python, PyTorch, and scikit-learn. I am experienced in frontend/backend development, 
    infrastructure, continuous integration, database engineering, networking and security. I was a technical director of a startup company, and I have a strong sense of responsibility and ownership in helping businesses grow.
    I have both worked in large corporations such as SAP and small startups and teams, and understand the challenges in different stages of creating a product and bringing it to market.
    (Fun fact: My fianc√©e works in the pharmaceutical industry and is studying ME. Biochemical Engineering at Western University, and I have a deep interest in the medical field. )`,
